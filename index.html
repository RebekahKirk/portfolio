            At home I am an active person, if I'm not cleaning my house (slightly obsessed) you'll find me on an adventure somewhere with my dog. Some day I'd like to live somewhere hot, I was not made for the great British weather!

            At work for a few years now I have felt a bit lost, like I needed to make a change but not sure what or how. An opportunity for me came along in the form of a coding course scholarship... so here I am more determined than ever to make this career change a sucessful one.
